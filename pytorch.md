## Pytorch Basics
Tensor is an important data structure of Pytorch. Pytorch tensors is like Numpy arrays but with more deep learning functionalities and is GPU friendly. GPU allows most operations with nn module and any calculations. Use model.to(device) and data.to(device) to move model and data to GPU (device='cuda') or cpu (device='cpu'). Must move model and data together, either both to cpu or both to gpu. Use `assert device == 'cuda'` to check if device is set to GPU. 

Pytorch Tensor is like Numpy array but with more functionalities including but not limited to: GPU acceleration, auto grad - automatic differentation, automatic gradient calculation, makes it easy for tensors to be a part of the forward pass and backward pass.
