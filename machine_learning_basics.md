## Introduction

**Machine Learning Libraries :** Pytorch, Tensorflow, MXNet, Keras, Caffe. 

- Hypothesis `h(X)`
- `y = f(X)`
- Big X is the feture matrix. Small y is the target/label vector (column). `f()` is the function, our model. 

Machine learning roadmap, machine learning workflow

Yann LeCun explains in class 90% of current machine learning is supervised learning - collect (feature, label) pairs.
