- $\bar{x}$ pronounced *x bar* sample mean average of $x$
- *variance* *standard deviation* are two popular measures of variability
- Variance $\sigma^2 = \frac{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \mu)^2} {n}$
- Variance $\sigma^2 = \frac{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2} {n-1}$
- Variance = roughly the average of squared deviation $\sum_(x_i - \mu)^2$
- Standard deviation $\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \mu)^2} {n}}$
- Standard deviation $\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2}$ equivalent of $\sigma = \sqrt{variance}$ 
- Standard deviation = square root of variance. On the same scale as the original data - easier to interpret than squared value (variance).
- R Squared $R^2$ "In statistics, the coefficient of determination, denoted $R^2$ or $r^2$ and pronounced "R squared", is the proportion of the variation in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s)." - Wikipedia
