The art of machine learning is to extract useful features from raw data (or training data). 

Types of features: Numeric features, Categorical features, Text features (and plenty more of unstructured data). 

When working with structured data, more columns of data isn't always better. It doesn't mean all columns are useful features. There is the issue of Curse of Dimensionality (definition): expoentially exponentially more data is needed to train machine learning models as the number of data attributes increase. On the other hand, more rows of data is a good thing. It means more of real world data is observed and collected. And that's a good thing. More rows of data is always better. More columns of data isnâ€™t necessarily better, especially if irrelevant features are included. We also need to be concerned with correlated columns and data leaks.
